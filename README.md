Data Standards For Space Data Systems

## Background

The [Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)](https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx) "...is a multi-national forum for the development of communications and data systems standards for spaceflight".

Founded in 1982, CCSDS has been publishing [Recommended Standards (called 'Blue Books')](https://public.ccsds.org/Publications/BlueBooks.aspx) to help standardize space messaging formats.

In 2010, CCSDS published an [XML SPECIFICATION FOR NAVIGATION DATA MESSAGES](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/505x0b1.pdf) to aid developers in creating web services based on CCSDS standards, using [eXtensible Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) as the [serialization format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization).  

This means that, to transfer messages between computers over networks, the data elements are converted in a text-based format using tags which look like [HyperText Markup Language (HTML)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), the basic format of the world wide web.

However, XML is not the only way to transmit messages between computers. The goal of this site is to add additional formatting options for CCSDS messages, as well as aid developers by generating code for use in applications.
