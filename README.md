Data Standards For Space Data Systems

## Background

The [Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)](https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx) "...is a multi-national forum for the development of communications and data systems standards for spaceflight".

Founded in 1982, CCSDS has been publishing [Recommended Standards (called 'Blue Books')](https://public.ccsds.org/Publications/BlueBooks.aspx) to help standardize space messaging formats.

In 2010, CCSDS published an [XML SPECIFICATION FOR NAVIGATION DATA MESSAGES](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/505x0b1.pdf) to aid developers in creating web services based on CCSDS standards, using [eXtensible Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) as the [serialization format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization).

This goal of this site is to add additional serialization options for CCSDS messages, as well as aid developers by generating code for use in applications.
