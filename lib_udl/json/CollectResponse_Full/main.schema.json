A collected state implies that additional activity is required for delivery/completion.\nCOMPLETED: The collect or contact has been completed. For many systems completed and delivered constitute an equivalent successful end state.\nDELIVERED: The collected observation(s) have been delivered to the requestor. For many systems completed and delivered constitute an equivalent successful end state. A DELIVERED state is typically used for systems that exhibit a delay between collect and delivery, such as with space-based systems which require ground contact to deliver observations.\nFAILED: The collect or contact was attempted and failed, or the delivery of the collected observation(s) failed. A FAILED status may be accompanied by an error code (errCode), if available.\nPARTIAL: A PARTIAL state indicates that a part of a multi-track request has been accomplished, but the full request is incomplete. A PARTIAL status should ultimately be resolved to an end state.\nPROPOSED: Indicates that the request was received and alternate collect or contact time(s) (altStartTime, altEndTime) have been proposed. If an alternate is accepted by the requestor the current request should be cancelled and a new request created.\nREJECTED: The request has been received and rejected by the provider.
