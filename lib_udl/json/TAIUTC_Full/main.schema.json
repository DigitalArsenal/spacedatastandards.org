      "description" : "/// International Atomic Time (TAI) is a statistical atomic time scale based on a large number of clocks operating at standards laboratories around the world that is maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures; its unit interval is exactly one SI second at sea level. The origin of TAI is such that UT1-TAI is approximately 0 (zero) on January 1, 1958. TAI is not adjusted for leap seconds.\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC) is defined by the CCIR Recommendation 460-4 (1986). It differs from TAI by the total number of leap seconds, so that UT1-UTC stays smaller than 0.9s in absolute value.   The decision to introduce a leap second in UTC is the responsibility of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS). According to the CCIR Recommendation, first preference is given to the opportunities at the end of December and June, and second preference to those at the end of March and September. Since the system was introduced in 1972, only dates in June and December have been used.  TAI is expressed in terms of UTC by the relation TAI = UTC + dAT, where  dAT is the total algebraic sum of leap seconds.\nThe first leap second was introduced on June 30, 1972. The historical list of leap seconds can be found in this table.",
