# Svelte JSON Schema Form

This is a Svelte component for generating forms based on a JSON schema. Though designed with use in the [webgme-taxonomy](https://github.com/webgme/webgme-taxonomy) dashboard in mind, it should be reasonably generic enough to use elsewhere when wanting to create forms based on a JSON schema.

*Though it currently only contains this `SchemaForm` component, this repo could be expanded and renamed to include other related components, such as generic dashboard components or webgme-related web components.*
