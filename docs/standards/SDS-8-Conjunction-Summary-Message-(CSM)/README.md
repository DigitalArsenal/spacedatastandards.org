## Space Data Standard - 8 - Conjunction Summary Message (CSM)

## Description

The Conjunction Summary Message (CSM) specifies a standard message format for use in exchanging spacecraft conjunction information between originators of Conjunction Assessments (CAs) and satellite owner/operators and other authorized parties, similar to a Conjunction Data Message. The message format is truncated to only include the minimum amount of data required to describe a conjunction event.

| TCA_RELATIVE_SPEED | The magnitude of the relative velocity at TCA. This value provides an indication of the risk (specific kinetic energy) for the two objects if they collided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| MAX_PROB           | Given fixed spherical object radii and relative distance at the time of closest approach (TCA), the projected covariance ellipse is sized and oriented to produce the maximum probability. For these reports the ratio of major-to-minor axes of the projected covariance ellipse is set using radial, in-track, and cross-track values of 100 m, 300 m, 100 m, respectively. If the combined object radius is greater than the relative distance, the maximum probability will be one; such occurrences are not addressed here.method                                                                                                                                                        |
| DILUTION           | The standard deviation that produces the maximum probability defines the threshold of dilution. A smaller or larger standard deviation will produce a smaller probability. In the case of computing true probability with a smaller standard deviation, the data is of sufficient quality to associate low probability with low risk. For a larger standard deviation, this is not the case and the resulting true probability calculation becomes "diluted." If operating in this dilution region, the recommendation is to obtain better data and reassess the encounter. If time or resources do not permit, then the maximum probability should be used in place of the true probability. |
