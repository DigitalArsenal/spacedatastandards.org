  /// Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) frame: Rotates with Earth. Origin at Earth's center. X-axis towards prime meridian, Y-axis eastward, Z-axis towards North Pole. Ideal for terrestrial points.
  ECEF,
  /// International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF): An inertial frame fixed relative to distant stars. Based on quasars. Used for precision astronomy and unaffected by Earth's rotation.
  ICRF,
  /// True Equator Mean Equinox (TEME): Used in SGP4 model for satellite tracking. Accounts for Earth's precession and nutation. Dynamic frame useful for orbit prediction.
  TEME,
  /// East-North-Up (ENU): Local tangent plane system for surface points. "East" eastward, "North" northward, "Up" perpendicular to Earth's surface. Suited for stationary or slow-moving objects at low altitudes.
  ENU,
  /// North-East-Down (NED): Common in aviation and navigation. "North" northward, "East" eastward, "Down" towards Earth's center. Aligns with gravity, intuitive for aircraft and vehicles.
  NED,
  /// North-East-Up (NEU): Similar to NED but "Up" axis is opposite to gravity. Suited for applications preferring a conventional "Up" direction.
  NEU,
  /// Radial-Intrack-Cross-track (RIC): Aligned with spacecraft's UVW system. "Radial" axis towards spacecraft, "In-track" perpendicular to radial and cross-track, "Cross-track" normal to orbit plane. Used for spacecraft orientation and tracking.
  RIC,
  /// Earth Mean Equator and Equinox of J2000 (J2000): An Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) frame defined by Earth's mean equator and equinox at the start of the year 2000. Fixed relative to distant stars, used for celestial mechanics and space navigation.

  /// Polar-North-East (PNE): A variation of local coordinate systems typically used in polar regions, with axes aligned toward the geographic North Pole, Eastward, and perpendicular to the Earth's surface.
